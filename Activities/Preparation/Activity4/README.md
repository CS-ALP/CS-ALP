# Activity 4

- Make a program that takes two integer inputs `x` and `y`. <br>
- Print out a grid of periods (.) that are of `x` width and `y` length.

> Hint: use nested loops

Example input:
    <pre><code>4
               2
    </code></pre>
    
Example output:
    <pre><code>....
               ....
