# Activity 3

For this activity, this will have two sub-activities that you may take. <br>
You are <b>NOT</b> required to take both of them, you may submit either one of the two activities or you may submit both, if you like.

## Activity 3.1

- Make a program that takes two inputs, concatenates these two inputs, and then outputs one string.

Example input:
    <pre><code>Hello
               world!
    </code></pre>
`
Example output:
    <pre><code>Hello world!
    </code></pre>

You can use any programming language that you wish, as long as the outputs are the same. <br>
Submit this in this repository directly with the following file name: `LASTNAME_Activity3-1.FILETYPE` 

## Activity 3.2

- Make a program that takes 4 inputs, and outputs these in a 2x2 grid. <br>
- The first and third inputs <b>must be a string.</b> <br>
- The second and fourth inputs <b>must be an integer.</b>

Example input:
    <pre><code>hello
               4
               world
               612
    </code></pre>
    
Example output:
    <pre><code>hello 4
               world 612
    </code></pre>

You can use any programming language that you wish, as long as the outputs are the same. <br>
