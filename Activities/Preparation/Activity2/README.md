Make a program that takes two inputs, and adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides them.
Print each of these outputs with the following style:

> Operator: Result

Example input:
    <pre><code>$ LASTNAME_Activity1.py 4 3
    </code></pre>
    
Example output:
    <pre><code>Addition: 2
        Subtraction: 5
        Multiplication: 2
        Division: 1
    </code></pre>
(values not accurate)

You can use any programming language that you wish, as long as the outputs are the same. <br>
